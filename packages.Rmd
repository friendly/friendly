This page provides an overview of my R packages and those I have contributed to.

## Multivariate linear models

### heplots

Provides HE plot and other functions for visualizing hypothesis
    tests in multivariate linear models. HE plots represent sums-of-squares-and-products 
    matrices for linear hypotheses and for error using ellipses (in two
    dimensions) and ellipsoids (in three dimensions). The related 'candisc' package
    provides visualizations in a reduced-rank canonical discriminant space when
    there are more than a few response variables.

### candisc

Functions for computing and visualizing 
	generalized canonical discriminant analyses and canonical correlation analysis
	for a multivariate linear model.
	Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a one-way 'MANOVA'
	design and is equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of quantitative
	response variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor variable.
	The 'candisc' package generalizes this to higher-way 'MANOVA' designs
	for all factors in a multivariate linear model,
	computing canonical scores and vectors for each term. The graphic functions provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) 
	visualizations of terms in an 'mlm' via the 'plot.candisc' and 'heplot.candisc' methods. Related plots are
	now provided for canonical correlation analysis when all predictors are quantitative.
	
### mvinfluence

[<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/friendly/mvinfluence/master/man/figures/logo.png' height='120' align='left' style="padding:'20px'">](https://github.com/friendly/mvinfluence)

Computes regression deletion diagnostics for multivariate linear models and provides some associated
	diagnostic plots.  The diagnostic measures include hat-values (leverages), generalized Cook's distance, and
	generalized squared 'studentized' residuals.  Several types of plots to detect influential observations are
	provided.

### matlib

### gellipsoid

### two way
